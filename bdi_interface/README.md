This folder is intended for use with the Boston Dynamics supplied proprietary ATLAS interface libraries.
These libraries were supplied to DRC Teams and are not publically available. If you have access to the libraries,
copy the AtlasSimInterface* and AtlasRobotInterface* into this folder and run the "install_bdi_interface.sh" script.
